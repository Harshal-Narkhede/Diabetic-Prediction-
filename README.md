# Diabetic-Prediction-
In this project, I utilized SVM to create a diabetes prediction model trained on medical data. Preprocessing involved analysis, normalization, and standardization. The model achieved impressive accuracy in forecasting diabetes cases.

# Key Features
- Utilization of SVM algorithm for diabetes prediction.
- Training the model using medical data like blood glucose, insulin levels, and diabetes labels.
- Data pre-processing involving analysis and standardization to optimize the machine learning model.
- Achievement of commendable accuracy in predicting diabetes cases.
